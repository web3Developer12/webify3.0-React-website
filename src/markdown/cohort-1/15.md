<p id="sub-md"><span id="special-word">Accountability</span> is the guarantee that security-related actions can be linked to the person or group responsible. In systems where a thorough audit is necessary owing to the nature of the business, such as in electronic trading systems, this is typically supplied by logging and audit procedures. When a trade is entered into an audit record with a date and timestamp and the entity's identification is formed and preserved in the log file, detailed logs are essential to track an entity's activity. This log file may be a standalone ASCII text log file on a system or a database that is optionally encrypted.</p>
