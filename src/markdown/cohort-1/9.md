<p id="sub-md"><span id="special-word">The science of making information secure in the presence of adversaries is known as cryptography</span>. It does so under the assumption that enemies have unlimited resources. Ciphers are algorithms that encrypt or decode data so that it is unintelligible to an opponent if intercepted without decoding, which requires a secret key.</p>
<br>
<p id="sub-md"><span id="special-word">Cryptography</span> is primarily employed to provide a service of confidentiality. It is not a full solution on its own; rather, it is a critical building piece inside a larger security system to handle a security problem. Securing a blockchain environment, for example, necessitates the use of numerous cryptographic primitives, such as hash functions, symmetric key cryptography, digital signatures, and public key cryptography.</p>
<br>
<p id="sub-md">Cryptography in addition to providing confidentiality, also provides other security services such as <span id="special-word">integrity, authentication (entity authentication and data origin authentication), and non-repudiation</span>. Accountability, which is required in many security systems, is also offered.</p>
